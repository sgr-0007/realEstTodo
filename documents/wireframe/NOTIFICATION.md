# NOTIFICATIONS WireFrame #

Notifications are shown in two use cases:

1. **Use Case 1:**
   This occurs when the user is within the range of the Main-Task geofencing radius.

2. **Use Case 2:**
   This notification is displayed when there is a nearby schedule. The notification is sent one hour
   before the scheduled event, and it includes a timer running within the notification.
