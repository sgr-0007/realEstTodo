# REAL ESTATE TODO

This app is used to track a Real Estate Agent's TODO list, which helps in selling properties or
maintaining them. While there could be another user journey, such as a client planning to buy a
property, for now, we are focusing solely on the agent's perspective.

-----

In our use case:

- "Main-task" represents the property.
- "Sub-task" represents the processes related to selling or maintaining the property.

The primary features we are concentrating on (applying to both main-task and sub-task) include:

1. **ADD / EDIT / DELETE** for both tasks.
2. Adding images to tasks.
3. Adding location information. In the case of the main-task, we refer to this as "Verify Property,"
   where a person is required to upload their current location from GPS.
4. Pre-defined labels for later use in task filtering.
5. Geo-fencing to provide alerts based on the current user's location.
6. Filtering main-tasks and sub-tasks based on labels.
